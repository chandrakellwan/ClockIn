# ClockdIn

ClockdIn is an Employee Management System that allows users to set schedules for part- and full-time employees.
Still in its infancy, ClockdIn only has the ability to support a single location; in the future it will be expanded so that many schedules can be created for many different clients.

# Features:  
  * Managers are able to create employees and add shifts.
  * Each Employee can create an account and sign in to see their shifts.
  * Managers and employees both can see the shifts for everyone who is scheduled.
  * Employees have the option to set their availability, managers are notified when a shift is created outside of this range.
  * The schedule can be viewed one week at a time (with a day-by-day break down), or one day at a time (with an hour-by-hour breakdown)
  * Work days start at 6am and end at 5am...so overnight workers can easily see a shift that technically spans two days.
  
# Future Additions:  
  * Employees will get a more personalized view to see only their own shifts.
  * Managers and employees both will get a report that includes total hours worked for the current week/month.
  * Managers will be able to set employee wage and track labor costs.
  * Managers will be able to create shift templates to more easily assign work to employees (i.e. "Morning Prep, 8am - 5pm").
  * Employees will be able to make requests for days off, managers will be notified when a request is made, as well as when a new shift overlaps with this request.
